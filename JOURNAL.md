I started by choosing the layout which will be a 75% layout.
I decided to use the nice!nano2 as my microcontroller, which will let me make the keyboard wireless.
It has 68 switches (currently) and a GPIO expender.

I had routed my board but decided to completely reroute it to make it look nicer.

I started on a case design. I am using Fusion360 and if that doesnâ€™t work I will use Shapr3d. The walls will be 7.5mm thick and 12.5mm tall. The floor will be 3mm tall.

I am making it sandwich mounted as it seems simplest for me.
I added M2 holes (still searching for screw)
I added M2 heatsets.

Done with the whole thing, only the readme left.
